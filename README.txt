Hello!

  Here is introductory project for PIC10F206 microcontroller
made by http://www.microchip.com
  
  The project just flashes two LEDs and Outputs two tones
to speaker.

  Schematics is in ExpressPCB sub folder.

  Project has been tested on DM163045 PICDEM Lab Development Kit
with PicKit 3 programmer (included in PICDEM). All used parts
are included in that kit.

  Tested in MPLAB X IDE v1.80
